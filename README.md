# Get Started Page

This project was originally designed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com) by following [Angela's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_TjoSnaI3CTgIgmSn3rruA) youtube videos, specifically the [Figma Web Design Tutorial | Figma UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYCesPcxpEw&ab_channel=AngelaDelise).

After the initial project, I added additional sections & created additional designs for phone, tablet, and desktop. You can check out my favicon [here](https://www.figma.com/file/yYnZcIHL1Idnkyq3bIPAfs/Get-Started-Responsive-Page?node-id=0%3A1).

After completeing the new versions of the original figma design, I recreated it with HTML, CSS and JS.
